## Hey, I'm Sujoy.

Throughout our lifetime, we introduce ourselves to hundreds of new people everywhere we go. Every time we strike up a conversation with a stranger sitting next to us on the train, duck into a gas station to ask for directions or step up to the checkout counter, we’re constantly coming up with new, creative ways to introduce ourselves in line with the circumstances. And we hardly ever realize we’re doing it.

I switch on my laptop to code, but end up spending hours on YouTube. Life's good.
